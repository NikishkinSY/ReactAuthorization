# ReactAuthorization

- Front-End: React-Redux app is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

- Back-End: ASP.NET Core app with authorization and registration based on JWT

- Both Frond and Back have tests

P.S. To make it works, don't forget to check host address in configs
